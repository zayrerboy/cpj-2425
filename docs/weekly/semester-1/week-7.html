              </h1>
              <p>
                This week, I attended the consultation feeling unsure of my RPO draft because I didn’t know how my
                research became a
                big-picture problem. It was initially so fun about body senses and questioning the natural, but the
                state of my
                proposal did not encompassed my interests. I was then given a mindmap after explaining my readings. Then
                I
                identified that perhaps queer ecology is not the main pillar. Timothy Morton’s idea of ecology without
                nature is what inspired contemporary practices like the Institute of Queer Ecology. With that in mind, I
                began to rework my RPO.

              <h2><em>① Reframe, Reframed, and still Reframing </em> 😭</h2>
              <p>
                I made four versions of RPO, each identifying so many different problems, like
                (1) Environment sensors can be more fun, (2)Companies use sensors for more consumption, (3) People’s
                idea of nature can be more nuanced
                (4) Biotechnology should be more ethical, and the list goes on…

            <div class="column">
              <p>
                And I ended up with this:

                1st Pillar: The Evolution of Environment Sensors;
                The existence of sensors;
                Community-sensing and community data;
                Sensors as environmental art.

                2nd Pillar: Ecology Without Nature and Interspecies;
                the traditional view of nature;
                A need to reframe people’s mindset;
                As it supports more pro-environment behaviour.

                3rd Pillar: Towards an interspecies future;
                Will the speculative design help me bridge this gap?

                As the RPO felt like it was not going anywhere with the formative approaching, I just stopped and wanted
                to make things. I feel frustrated with terms, such as interspecies, becoming ambiguous as I apply the
                concept in writing. As formative was soon, I wanted use the concept in practice to gain more clarity.

                The term interspecies became increasingly ambiguous as I read papers across technology, design and
                ecology from scholars referring to words like human and non-human interacting with each other in
                different contexts.

                <p>Reflection:</p>
                <li>The result from this task was realising interspecies is indeed so fluid. What Donna refers to
                  interspecies is the act of human interacting with a non-human aiming for mutual benefits through
                  technology. Every relationship between species can be studied from an ecological standpoint to
                  ultimately minimise human-biases. So, what my research focus on is a future where hybrid entities
                  are attached to environment sensors to encourage environmental stewardship. In this sense,
                  environmental sensors are the technology in question.

                  future is the least offensive? The objective of this task was to get in touch with my imagination

              <ul>

                Is was a fun process, and I think it met my objectives in trying to re-engage with my imaginations.
                While
                I am still uncertain about if I should go with animal or plant based hybrids, the conclusion I drew from
                this is that I like forms that are more mythical.

                After the two tasks, I asked if there were some overlapping interests I have thus far? Can I narrow down
                to a single bodily extension for now? In terms of prosthetic, I see an overlapping interest in the area
                of being totally undefinable to the human form. Why do i feel more comfortable hiding behind a
                prosthetic? Can the prosthetic work in conjunction with the human body? Pulse sensor? Can my human form
                be a Tardigrade?

              I did a task mapping exercise and realised I couldn’t make things I enjoy. I just know that if I am

              didn't even know their name. I can only explain it by image association.

                  Reflecting on weeks zero to seven, I realised the problem was that I had to update my CPJ regularly.
                  Updating weeks five to seven made me realise I missed out on opportunities for meaningful feedback and
                  reflection. It was only
                  when I put everything aside and start updating my CPJ that the ideation process began to be clearer.
                  Althought most of them were just sort of eliminating bad ideas, they still contribute to the project in some ways.
