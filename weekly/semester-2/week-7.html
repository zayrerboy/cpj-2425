              <p class="p__size-l">
                This week, I focused on preparing for a show-and-tell with the atelier to share my progress. These
                preparations includes prototyping <em> A Friendly Hand </em>with cardboard to check for sizing, sourcing
                materials, and creating an alternative visualisation in case I’m unable to produce all eight <em>Friendly
                Hands </em> as initially envisioned in <em> Dance, Forest Dance.</em>

              <h2>Part ① : Sizing, Sourcing & Preparing</h2>
              <p>
                To make A Friendly Hand friendlier, I started sourcing materials, including a smaller breadboard, a new
                Arduino, and a micro servo, to better understand the dimensions needed for the dual-layered platform. To
                aid this process, I used cardboard to create a rounded platform and position the required moving parts.

            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <p>
                Another key step was determining the necessary height for the micro servo underneath, ensuring it has
                enough clearance to rotate freely without obstruction. The size that I have opt for the dual-layer
                platform was 260 x 140mm - which will fit perfectly when the hand is folded up slightly.

              <h2>Part ② : A Friendly Hand, But How Many?</h2>
              <p>
                Reflection on Scale & Feasibility:
                <br>Visualization 7 is, well… ambitious. But I’ve been thinking a lot about the logistics and cost of
                such a grand delivery, and honestly, about how I want to present myself as a designer/artist. I mean,
                sure—it would be impressive to make eight or even ten hands, but let’s be real: that’s going to cost at
                least $350, based on what I’ve already spent earlier on one mockup.


              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">

              <p>
                But beyond budget constraints, a question that also keeps brewing in my head: the irony of it
                all. As much
                as A Friendly Hand is playful and a little silly thing, Dance, Forest Dance carries an artistic message
                that
                is… fragile, poetic, vulnerable through its movement. If I scale it up too much, does it lose some of
                that intimacy? How do I balance humor and depth without losing the essence of the work?
                <br> <br>
                Leaning into Humour & Irony:
                <br>
                Feeling a bit conflicted about tone, scale and budget, I started rethinking scale
                altogether. What if instead of many hands, there was just one… or three? This shift led me to an
                alternative visualization—one that leans into humor and irony rather than just spectacle.

              It can also be seen as an indulgence but I wanted to explore an alternate version as a proposal during
              this making
              process. Regardless, I will still be making three hands, which feels quite meaningful in relation to
              ecologist Suzanne Simard’s 1997 revelation on the mycorrhizal network through a study on the mutualistic
              relationship of birch trees, Douglas fir, and a young fir seedling.</p>

              <p>
                The week ended with a show-and-tell at the atelier. I was a bit nervous—partly because we hadn’t had one
                in a while, and partly because, so far, I think only four out of twelve people in the atelier are really
                following my progress. Plus, A Friendly Hand is a bit abstract, and I have to work to get people to
                understand its vulnerable, fragile, yet oddly cute nature. So yeah, of course, I was nervous.

            <div class="column">

              <p>
                I didn’t put a lot of effort into the setup—which I probably should have. But for this show-and-tell, I
                had been rehearsing a lot in my head, making sure I could share my ideas in a clear and concise way. I
                tried my best to translate the mind map from Week 6 as effectively as possible. I was mostly just
                sharing my humble learnings from ecologist Suzanne Simard and communicating the conceptual build behind
                A Friendly Hand.

                <h2>Week 7 : Feedback & Reflection</h2>
     

                <p>
                  The feedback from the atelier was that my project was <i>"weird,"</i> to which I simply replied:
                  <i>"Tsk."</i> But then, they clarified—it was <i>"good-weird."</i> So, I guess it’s safe to say my
                  atelier finds it interesting, especially considering the occasional <i>nodding, laughter,</i> and
                  <i>scattered applause</i> at the end of the show-and-tell.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The <b>video documentation</b> I presented still feels <i>up in the air</i>—I’m not fully convinced by
                  it yet. However, a key piece of feedback was to explore <b>different visuals on the screen</b> to
                  better control the <i>expression and animation</i> of the hand. For example, a <i>blinking
                    black-and-white screen</i> could signal <i>happiness</i>, while <i>algorithmic moving circles</i>
                  might express <i>distress</i>. This feedback was really interesting because it has the potential to
                  serve <b>multiple roles</b>—as <i>content for the publication, a control mechanism for the video, and
                    even a live interaction</i> for the audience to witness <i>A Friendly Hand’s</i> expressive
                  capacity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As for my <b>reflection</b>, I think these are ideas worth keeping <i>in view</i>, but right now, my
                  focus should be on <b>prototyping <i>A Friendly Hand</i> to look as charming as possible</b>. I say
                  <i>charming</i> because, realistically, there’s a <i>limit</i> to how <i>sleek</i> it can look, given
                  the materials it’s built from and the <i>story</i> those materials tell. So, for now, my goal is to
                  <b>replicate the original <i>Friendly Hand’s</i> charming quality as best I can.</b>
                </p>
