              <h1>Week 4 : Introducing Frameworks</h1>
              <p class="p__size-l">
                This week, I dove deeper into the origins of my project and introduced frameworks to refine the
                discussion portion of my dissertation. As reflected in Week 3, I need to revisit the
                foundation of my research—re-examining my literature review, identifying a question worth exploring, and
                strengthening the concept of <em> What if trees had hands?</em>

                The knowledge is already there. I just need to finesse the organisation of my content and clarify how it
                all connects.

              <h2>Part ① : The Double Diamond Framework</h2>
              <p>
                The first thing I did was look back at my research through the lens of the double-diamond framework to
                map out my process. Initially, I knew I was conducting research through design—using design as a method
                of inquiry, generating knowledge through practice-based exploration. However, since I tend to work
                divergently, I thought the double diamond might help me converge my ideas and make sense of my making
                process. To apply it, I used the Design Council worksheet, plotting down my entire thought process.
              </p>

            <div class="column">
              <p>
                In the first diamond, representing Discover, I started with my creative problem: the sensory
                loss caused by our increasing dependence on electronic devices, which substitute and mediate our
                engagement with the natural world. However, this isn’t just a problem with technology alone—it reflects
                a larger systemic issue rooted in the way modern society structures human-nature relationships.

            <div class="column">
              <p>
                Subsequently, through literature review I discover Schwartzman’s See Yourself Sensing, I explored how
                speculative prosthetics could extend human perception beyond functional augmentation. Page’s
                Interspecies Communication & Performance introduced the idea of using technology as a medium for
                non-human expression, rather than just human control. Finally, defining a brief through a review on
                Anderson’s critique on art and design tackling anthropocene, or other words promote ecocenmtrism, led me
                to question whether speculative prosthetics for nature could move beyond employing organic matter -
                which recitifies what I was questioning last week.

                From here, I arrived at my brief: 'Dreaming of an Interspecies Sensor'; To use speculative
                methodologies—critical-making, conceptual exploration, and experimental design—to reimagine human/nature
                interactions through sensors and artificial materials.

              <h2>Part ② : The Cognitive-Affective-Behavioural Relationship Framework</h2>
              <p>
                As I was making minor adjustments to my dissertation, I realise a methodology that I've been adopting
                while exploring A Friendly Hand has been about assessing whether it builds 'intimacy' with people. I
                think its important that at the end of the day people can intuitively feel connected with the such an
                experimental prototype that is supposedly aims to encourage 'affective' relationship with nature - one
                that considers aspects such as Partnership, Participation, Connectedness, and a Holistic relationship.

            <div class="column">
              <p>
                And so, I found The Cognitive-Affective-Behavioral Relationship Framework - a a conceptual model that
                examines how cognitive (thought-based), affective (emotion-based), and behavioral (action-based)
                dimensions interact to shape the overall quality of relationships. It was originally used to assess the
                relationship dynamics between consumers and corporations. However, in this case, I thought it might
                usefull for me to structure my explorations, user-testing and critical-making that will outline my
                discussion portion.

              <h2>Part ③ : Outlining My Discussion</h2>
              <p>
                All of this happened in my head and scribbles on post-its. A few discarded ideas later, I landed on this
                outline: "What if
                trees could draw, sing, and dance with us?"

                When I was developing this outline, I was thinking about Root-Watching (from Week 10) and reflecting on
                my making process for <em>A Friendly Hand</em> throughout Semester 1 and 2. See, my work might seem like a
                product of my visceral process, but there were also deeper thought processes—symbolic meanings I didn’t
                explicitly share while making them. Partly because of embarrassment over my esoteric, slightly chaotic
                metaphors.

            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <p>
                Anyway, the concept can be viewed in three parts. First, "What if trees had hands?" And if trees did
                have hands, how would they draw, sing, and dance with us? Second, if trees could express themselves,
                what would they try to communicate? This is my way of breaking down interspecies communication and
                performance into smaller speculative questions—using design to explore new knowledge outside of its
                usual scope, particularly in science and ecological awareness.

                In other words, a discussion that encompassess 'research through design'. (refer to Sem 1, Week 3 for my
                notes on design research)

                with non-human life not through data extraction, but by staging new ways of sensing and engaging with

                Rather than concluding neatly like a double diamond, I see the process as either ongoing or
                branching off in multiple directions. I'm not done yet, and since speculative methodology prioritises
                the process over a fixed outcome, the ending feels less important. That said, the double diamond
                framework has helped me converge my thinking along the way.

                <h1>Week 4 : Feedback & Reflection</h1>
                <p>
                  sigh Okay. I think I kinda figured out my creative process. It’s like I’m a lateral-thinker, explorer,
                  always
                  wandering around in search of
                  one
                  concept
                  that feels worth expanding—especially something that’s passion-driven. And if I’m being really
                  honest...
                  I just wanted to try computational stuff, make slightly silly things, and have fun. But in an academic
                  setting,
                  “silly” comes with a lot of "framing-work" to do— because it has to be smart-enough silly. The framing
                  needs to
                  be consistently worked on to carve out a
                  space big enough to wiggle in but small enough so it doesn’t dissolve into pure noise.
                  <br><br>
                  My experimental journey felt like an open playground at the start, a fight for survival in the middle
                  and now I'm starting to find a way to tame my
                  visceral process through some.. let's say interesting choice of frameworks. HAHA.
                  <br><br>
                  As for feedback, I was basically advised to keep an eye on word count on my dissertation, cut what
                  isn’t necessary,
                  and—of course—be smart about how I frame, communicate, and deliver it.
