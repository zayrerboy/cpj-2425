                <p class="p__size-l">
                  This week, I focused on preparing for Open Studio which
                  involve producing a publication, setting up <i>A Friendly
                    Hand</i> interface, as well as the overall presentation of
                  the table. It ended with a reflection on some of the comments
                  from visitors.

                <h2>Part ①: Conceptualising, designing and printing the
                  Publication of
                  <em>Dreaming of an Interspecies Sensor</em></h2>

                <p>
                  Over the weekend, I began reflecting on how this project
                  started.
                  How could the publication add value beyond documenting the
                  process?
                  And more importantly—who am I writing for, beyond my own
                  desire to express?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Looking back to Week 0 of Semester One, the book <em>What
                    Design Can’t Do</em>
                  was a pivotal moment. It nudged me toward exploring
                  computation and critical
                  making—not just as tools, but as ways to reimagine what
                  design
                  could mean beyond
                  commercial or service outcomes. Partly existential, partly
                  driven by a search
                  for meaning outside the typical role of a graphic designer
                  in
                  society.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="column">
                <p>
                  The truth is, I still find deep comfort in arranging text
                  and
                  images, forming
                  visual systems, and printing them out. So this publication
                  is
                  both a method and
                  a message: a personal record of how a graphic designer
                  attempted to connect
                  with non-human life through speculative design. And oddly
                  enough, through making a paper hand move—tenderly, clumsily,
                  but with care. A book not just about
                  outcomes—but about sensing, imagining, and relating
                  differently.

                    I came up with a content flow that begins with a
                    preface—telling the story of my doubts as a graphic
                    designer,
                    and the doodle I made in Week 2 that kept haunting me. The
                    preface leads into what the book is really about:
                    a documentation of research, experiments, conversations,
                    and
                    a speculative framework for other creative
                    practioners/technologist who
                    interested in the deep process behind
                    <i>'A Friendly Hand'</i>.

                  I stopped at Chapter Five—the end of Case Study One, <i>Root
                    Watching</i>—because I was running out of time,
                  and it just wasn’t possible to finish everything I had
                  planned
                  before Open Studios.
                  Anyway, I printed the book on RJ paper; Excel Bulky Satin
                  250gsm (for
                  the cover) and 115gsm (for the inner signatures)
                  with Print De Creation at Sunshine Plaza. It’s
                  saddle-stitched
                  with the same orange thread and, for now,
                  I’m calling it "done" enough for Open Studios.

                  <p>
                    It was one day before Open Studios. I reminded myself that
                    it’s a showcase of our “work-in-progress,”
                    took a deep breath, and continued as planned. Some small
                    improvements included sourcing tiny pins, screws,
                    and magnets to mount posters and images on the wall.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="column">
                  <p>
                    Another important part was designing title cards to orient
                    each of the deliverables on the table,
                    as well as instructional cards for the interactive
                    artefacts.

                    The rest came down to personal aesthetics and
                    instinct—trying to make the overall presentation feel
                    organised,
                    inviting, and a little bit pretty.

                  The set-up went as planned; however, the video wasn’t
                  complete, and I didn’t feel confident playing it.
                  So instead, I left some of the field day clips on loop. As
                  for
                  the rest, I thought it looked pretty neat and organised.

                  <h2>Part ③: Developing a Script</h2>
                  <p>The other major part of my project was to be present to
                    share my stories. I very quickly realise I left out a very
                    important message in my set-up - which was the overall
                    intention of why I even began dreaming of an interspecies
                    sensor. Over
                    time, I started developing a script to share my project.
                    I usually start with this:
                  </p>
                  <p>The Script-In-Workshop:</p>
                  <p>
                    Ⓐ
                    <em>'Dreaming of an Interspecies Sensor'</em> began when I
                    started reflecting on my personal relationship with the
                    physical environment.
                    What I realised was stopping me from stepping outside and
                    <em>“being one with nature”</em> wasn’t a lack of
                    desire—it
                    was my electronic devices:
                    my phone, my tablet, my laptop.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ⓑ 'And then, I was curious:'
                    <em>How could these very tools that distance me from
                      nature
                      instead help me feel a sense of closeness to it?</em>
                    Through researching human–nature relationships, I learned
                    that although this disconnect felt personal,
                    it is also a societal issue—one that raises important
                    questions about the systems we live in and the
                    technologies
                    we depend on.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                  <p>
                    <p>
                      Ⓒ I then explored <em>interspecies communication and
                        performance</em>—practices that use sensors and
                      organic
                      matter not just
                      to form intimacy between humans and nature, but to
                      reimagine technology as a <em>poetic mediator</em>.
                      I was fascinated by what sensors could do—not in the
                      sense
                      of extracting signals by clipping wires onto leaves,
                      but in how they might still evoke connection, <em>even
                        in
                        their synthetic form</em>.
                      That’s where the strange little doodle I made at the
                      beginning of my project came in: a tree with multiple
                      limbs, reaching out—almost as if waving at me.
                      From there, the project grew into a framework guided by
                      speculative design methodologies and the prompt:
                      <em>What if trees could draw, sing, and dance with
                        us?</em>
                    </p>
                  </em>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Ⓓ What resulted is <em>A Friendly Hand</em>—a strange,
                  human-like paper hand inspired by the forest root system
                  known as the mycorrhizal network,
                  or the <em>“wood-wide web.”</em> Often visualised in science
                  communication as hands reaching out underground,
                  <em>A Friendly Hand</em> is a small sensing machine—part
                  prosthetic, part puppet—that brings something invisible into
                  visibility.
                  It responds to light through a pull-and-release mechanism,
                  showing signs of <em>“aliveness”</em> when it senses
                  brightness.
                  Because it reads raw digital values from light,
                  <em>different animations on the screen trigger different
                    behaviours</em>,
                  making the movement of the hand feel <em>poetic</em> and
                  <em>whimsical</em>.
                  To me, it felt like they were <em>dancing to light</em>.

                  <p>I had quite meaningful conversations, some of it started
                    with a question of why didn't I clip sensor on leaves.
                    Many
                    people asked how I envision the final delivery to look
                    like?
                    One talked to me about STELARC. A lot expressed their
                    opinions.

                    <h2>Week 12 : Feedback &
                      Reflection</h2>

                    <p>Not going to lie, this week was
                      <i>hella frustrating</i> because I
                      burst my <i>Arduino</i> and had to
                      wait
                      the entire week for my materials to
                      arrive. But these are problems that
                      couldn’t be helped without making
                      mistakes in my first iteration. So
                      yeah, I took this week to also work
                      on the design of this site.</p>

                    <p>To relieve some of the frustration,
                      I repurposed some of my <i>old-time
                        pixel
                        animations</i> that are now
                      decking cutely
                      out all over this site. I also
                      visualised some <i>mind maps</i>
                      from <i>Week 3 to Week 7</i> to
                      better explain
                      my project. Overall, not a
                      super bad
                      week—no major feedback other than
                      opting for a <i>bigger dual-layer
                        platform</i>.</p>
