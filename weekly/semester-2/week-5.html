                <h1>Week 5 : Construction Plan – Making A Friendly Hand
                  Friendlier</h1>
                <p class="p__size-l">
                  After gaining clarity, I finalised a proposal and
                  visualisation for the delivery of <em>A Friendly Hand </em>
                  this week, completing the 'delivery' section of my
                  double-diamond
                  framework. To ensure accessibility, I created a schematic
                  diagram and construction plan for others
                  to replicate the build and to guide my own making process.

                <p>
                  I realised that if A Friendly Hand is meant as a
                  well-researched proposal for communities exploring See
                  Yourself Sensing: Redefining Human Perception and
                  Interspecies Communication and Performance, then a
                  schematic diagram of how the Arduino kit is used is
                  essential. This would help other practitioners build
                  on the project and further their research.

                  In other words, the 'delivery' section of my double diamond
                  framework will be most valuable if it
                  includes a detailed plan—one that not only designs this
                  seemingly "silly" or "trivial" prototype for
                  friendlier encounters but also considers how material
                  choices add layers to the metaphor of the
                  Mycorrhizal Network. Some are more obvious, like using
                  threads to represent mycelium, while others are
                  more imaginative—wood and paper symbolizing trees, or a
                  micro servo embodying fungi.

                      Ultimately, it’s open to individual creativity and
                      interpretation. The goal is to address the
                      Anthropocene by materialising the hidden language of the
                      forest to – first and foremost - help people
                      form
                      'affective relationships' or empathy with the non-human
                      world and provoke self-reflection on the concept
                      of
                      interconnectedness – one where the links between what we
                      use, how we build, and what we take from nature
                      are easy to overlook, yet always present.

                      <p>
                        To complete the dissertation, I want to conclude with
                        a proposal for the delivery of A Friendly Hand.
                        Although a fixed outcome is not the priority, I reckon
                        communities surrounding speculative frameworks
                        might find value in how A Friendly Hand, an
                        alternative sensory engagement with ecological
                        systems, might be applied to real-life settings that
                        aims to communicate meaningful insights about our
                        environment to the everyday audience.

                        This final iteration below came about from a philosphy
                        of
                        positioning a Friendly Hand as playful rather than
                        unsettling. Reflecting on my previous visualisations
                        from Week 3, I realise that my earlier approach, where
                        A Friendly Hand performed a single
                        function—grasping or holding participants—felt
                        somewhat restrictive and even slightly eerie. Instead,
                        I
                        see more joy in allowing participants to choose how
                        they engage—whether by interacting with the hand,
                        the screen, or simply witnessing it move rhythmically
                        to beats.

                            The feedback on <em>Dance, Forest Dance</em> was
                            great. I explained it to three people in the
                            atelier, and they
                            were all excited to see how it might turn out. I
                            was also advised to develop A Friendly Hand into a
                            kit, proposing a way to make it accessible to more
                            creative practitioners—bridging music and
                            computational design in new ways.
                            <br><br>
                            To add on, realising that <em>A Friendly Hand</em>
                            should be playful rather than unsettling feels
                            like a
                            turning point in
                            my journey. It aligns with what I naturally
                            gravitate toward and embodies Dreaming of an
                            Interspecies
                            Sensor more fully—something dreamy and whimsical,
                            shaped through storytelling. Whether this
                            speculative object is perceived as cute or
                            unsettling doesn’t really matter; that’s for
                            participants
                            to decide and reflect on. My role is to better

                              about more is the progress of my dissertation.
