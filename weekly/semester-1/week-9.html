                This week, the atelier went through a brief introduction of Arduino and attended a talk by Feelers
                Feelers about their practice in the intersection of art and technology. I also began experimenting more
                with p5js
                and worked on a making a prosthetic hand.

                During the first workshop, the atelier was introduced to the different components of an Arduino kit and
                the resources available online to get started in arduino.

                We were then introduced to the different components such as motion sensor, light sensor, etc, and the
                one that I found partcularly simple and straightforwatd was the servo motor.

                <h2><em>‚ë° Let's make a hand! </em> </h2>
                <p>
                  During week 8 as i was writing my RPO, I became curious about how a prosthetic can allow users to be
                  in touch with nature intimately at the comfort of my desk. Also in relation to my previous taks and
                  interactions with nature, I realise I do like to touch nature and begin to wonder if a simple
                  prosthetic can help be ‚Äúin touch‚Äù with nature.

                </p>
              </li>
              <div class="column">
                <p>
                  Following a youtube tutorial, I made my first ever artificial hand with the materials I had - Paper,
                  Wall-plug and Strings. The process was not as easy as the wall plugs had very tiny holes to thread the
                  string through. As soon as I was done, I did some user-testing from touching my hands to face, a paper
                  ball to the nearest nature I could find.

                Then I got a bit creative and see how I can interact with this prosthetic. I put it at the back of my

                artificial hand to touch nature for humans‚Äù - well since my entire paper was about human and nature
                relationship. So then I brought it to Instagram to ask more people.

              my Week 7 of my ‚Äòpersonal archive‚Äô to look for some pictures. I recall photographing one particular
              picture, which I named ‚Äúcar-beautiful-tree-sky-humans-buildings.jpeg‚Äù , that took me three shots. First
              without zooom, second with zoom and third with more zoom and waiting for humans to walk away. Each time
              cropping away more things for my satisfaction.

                  But did I liked it? Probably. But the fact is I only remember the existence of this file becaue I
                  intently searched for nature picture in my phone gallery. Recalling the three shots it took, I printed
                  the picture out and erased things that I wanted to crop out further.

                  Using white posca marker, like a correction tool, I removed things like cars, humans, buildings and
                  well, just urban stuff. The result is a form derivative of my perception of what I saw in the tree
                  outside Rochor.

                  Feeling happy with my outcome, I shared it with my fellow designer/friend and her immediate response
                  were
                  ‚Äúwow what is this?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can imagine a drawing over it‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt surprised because she‚Äôs an
                  illustrator‚Ä¶

              <li>
                <p>
                  But what surprised me was how quick she responded with a drawing of species. Suddenly, the project in
                  week 7 when I was trying to imagine a new form of ‚Äúhybrid entities‚Äù revived into a new idea.

                  here being reflected in Feelers Feelers practice. Plus, the fact that an art and technology company
                  exists in Singapore blows my mind.

                  Reflecting on weeks zero to seven, I realised the problem was that I had to update my CPJ regularly.
                  Updating weeks five to seven made me realise I missed out on opportunities for meaningful feedback and
                  reflection. It was only
                  when I put everything aside and start updating my CPJ that the ideation process began to be clearer.
                  Althought most of them were just sort of eliminating bad ideas, they still contribute to the project
                  in some ways.
