              </h1>
              <!-- <p>
                As I start this week, I am grappling with doubts, uncertainties, and insecurities regarding my
                reserach proposal outline (RPO). Following the advice of my first marker, I began brainstorming a
                prototype for a
                sensing machine called "feelers," which reimagines how humans can perceive their physical environment.
                In my eagerness to deliver a working prototype, I immediately started experimenting with accessible
                materials and light sensors. At the same time, the pressure to work on RPO feedback for my dissertation
                draft submission was
                mounting, so I also dedicated time this week to reading about the human-nature relationship and
                environmental degradation.

                  This week's consultation began with a question. I was asked, "What do you envision a project titled
                  â€˜Dreaming of an Interspecies Natureâ€™ to look like?" My immediate response was something along the
                  lines of "a device that I could use outdoors." That question resonated deeply with me, making me
                  realize that I should be creating prototypes that enable people to engage with the physical
                  environment. Regardless of the narrative, it seems quite clear that a prototype bridging the physical
                  environment and human experience is essential, doesnâ€™t it?

                  After receiving feedback, I created new sketches and developed a narrative about technological
                  mediation over natural experiences, using "feelers" as a metaphor and a solution to help
                  people reconnect with nature - like growing feelers, gentle extensions that restore our sensitivity
                  to the environment weâ€™ve grown numb to. I began transforming my sketches into a prototype and started
                  experimenting with materials such as ice cream sticks, rubber hands, and tape, along with an Arduino
                  kit and a light sensor. My goal is to design a device that can receive tactile input and provide a
                  visual output. I managed to get something out of it however, due to lack of experience, I landed on a
                  prototype that needed some assitance.

                  This week feedback was even worst than last week. I presented my progress on â€˜feelersâ€™ and was met
                  with even more doubts and question about what im doing. I am usually quite sure of my process but this
                  time for some reason i could not genuinely defend my idea. I was lost. The hour long feedback turned
                  into a lecture about how my narrative lacked nuances and my prototype lacked criticality. I was then
                  given an example of existing speculative design like â€˜Animal Superpowersâ€™ and was advised to relook
                  into my progress.

                  The pressure to keep up with my timeline is weighing on me, especially since I haven't been updating
                  CPJ in real time, and Iâ€™ve realized that this has not been helpful. Additionally, I've noticed that
                  spending time digesting readings and new concepts without narrowing my reserach scope hasn't
                  contributed much to my project too. It feels like my making and writing never sync up, like two broken
                  Bluetooth devices trying to connect. AM I WORRIED? YES. What am I worried about? Updating my
                  dissertation, catalogue of making, creative process journal and well, at this point at least something
                  on the table for summative submission.
