                  Going to an electronic store can be intimadating so the best I could do was to prepare a shopping
                  list. Sunlight @ Sim Lim Tower at Rochor, Singapore, has pretty good staff that are willing to assist
                  in your questions.

                  a little better after I was greeted by a heart from the Arduino.

              <p>
                Keeping things simple, the first thing I tried was to get the motor moving. It opened Arduino’s website
                to get a sample code for motor and within 30mins I got the motor to move.

                Next, I explored how I can incorporate the pulling mechanism of the prototype to the servo motor. My
                first
                idea was to makeshift a coiling mechanism for the string. So, the first iterations included chopstick,
                tapes and wallplug.
              </li>
              <li>
                One of the major component in this set-up is the importance of keeping both the motor and prototype
                stucked to the surface. Although the tape worked for the prosthetic, the tape holding down the motor
                kept breaking off each time it moved. The coiling method did not work either. Neither did simplifying
                the coiling prototype helped.
              </li>
            </ul>

                  Feeling frustrated I asked Tammy for help and she suggested why don’t I just tie the string into the
                  holes of the motor blade. To solve the tension problem between motor and prototype, I decided to make
                  use the table and more tapes to provide better support.

              <li>
                <p>
                  This set up was successful and some of the key factors were (1) building good tension between motor
                  and prosthetic and (2) tying knot straight onto the provided blades of motor.

                  Reflection: <br> The prototype is successful however it did not have the same intimacy as before. The
                  first
                  prototype felt more intimate as there was an input and output by human efforts. This prototype only
                  has an input and output that is pre-determined. Hence, my next iterations would involve another
                  sensor as input.

                  Reflections: <br><br>The interviews were helpful in knowing people around my age have the desire to
                  form emotional
                  connection with the natural (physical) world.<br><br>
                  Holding hands are intimate for humans. Science has an explanation called the 'oxytocin', often called
                  the "love hormone" or "bonding hormone as it evokes a sense of security and closeness. Throughout
                  history, humans have
                  always engage in their sense of touch for survival, relying on
                  close physical proximity to form social bonds and ensure protection within groups.
              </ul>

                  However, the idea of physical closeness blurs as we enter a digital age where our senses and
                  perception are constantly shaped and altered with technological devices. <br><br> Acknowledging the
                  good and bad of electronic devices between humans, my question lies with the non-humans. In what ways
                  might
                  sensing machines (or electronic devices) mediate social bonds between humans and non-humans, raising
                  questions about the nature of mutual protection and intimacy in interactions like physical touch or
                  holding hands?

              <p>
                Reflecting on Week 7's attempt at an online 'hybrid generator', I had a burning passion to redeem
                myself
                by reinventing the 'Tracing roots' activity to live.</p>

                <p>
                  So, I first went on to P5js to look for a drawing pad JS code which led me to user;fffiloni. After
                  testing his basic code, I realised I needed a ‘undo’ button. So, that began my journey utilising
                  ChatGPT 4.0 to assist my vision.

                  and “can i change the background to an image instead?”, I was able to create a website where users can
                  draw over an background image. Disclaimer: This was also only possible with basic HTML and p5JS
                  lessons that I received at LASALLE College of the Arts for over 6 months, seperately.

                  The website went through an initial round of user-testing to check for the performance. The drawing
                  pad operated smoothly as expected however as I was reviewing the outcomes, I was curious to see users’
                  creations without the background image.

                  users’ drawing. I have a few reasons for that decision. Firstly, I wanted users’ to see, and possibly
                  be surprised by, their creations to encourage a sense of agency over their expression online.

                  Next, I decided on an aesthetic that didn’t look too serious. I kept the styling (CSS) simple to
                  reflect the attitudes of a ‘cozy web’. Cozy web refers to an intimate, small-scale internet experience
                  where users connect in close-knit, personalised online spaces. Platforms like Tumblr and neocities
                  that priortises fostering community and warmth.

                  – in contrast to the vast and impersonal mainstream platforms. One of the key proponents of this
                  concept is Laurel Schwulst, who wrote an influential essay titled "My Website is a Living Thing" in
                  2019.

                  The user interface is kept simple. I avoided explaining too much about my objective of fostering
                  relationship between humans and nature. Rather, I chose to encourage users to imagine the otherwordly
                  scenes.

                  This goal aligns with Morton’s “Ecology without Nature” where he argues that artists, or anyone who
                  imagines our environment, one should consider how it’s reflects human acitivities. The act of users’
                  simply imgaining life forms that are out of the norm contributes to the bridging of the nature and
                  culture divide.

              Another component to the UX is linking an Are.na channel for users to upload their creations. This was
              inspired by designer, Elliott Cost, where he collected park videos using are.na channel for his website
              called One Minute Park. The component of allowing users to upload their

                  Reflection: <br>
                  Reflecting on the exercise, I recalled Week 9's sharing from ‘Feelers Feelers’ where we were
                  introduced to us their concept of a ‘Greener Screen’. One of the key theory to for a sustainable web
                  is
                  to opitmise and minimise the jpeg files to reduce energy consumption and cognitive power of the uesrs.

                  If the goal of this experiment is to build better intimacy between humans and non-humans through a
                  website. Can there be a process where no images have to be uploaded? How can I bring more life to
                  users while expressing online?

                  Cornway’s game of life was quite a discovery. Originating from the theory of cellular automaton
                  where math meets tech, the dynamic and evolving patterns allows users to interact with 'life' made
                  from
                  the simple rules of life and death.

                  Sticking to the idea of a drawing pad, could the act of placing or removing pixels on a grid symbolise
                  the creation process? and the system of finding neighbouring cells represent life?

                  The idea of a drawing pad / game of life was so applicable for anything. I tried it over the the image
                  of the roots and introduced a new rule where the pixels do not turn postive. The result look like a
                  bonsai root getting into eaten by pixels HAHAHA.

                <p>
                  It wasn't much of a feedback but more of a appreciation for my creative journey and expression. I was
                  then
                  introduced to a online seminar of 'A Knowing Wrongness' by Fraser Muggeridge - a graphic designer who
                  did his PHD thesis on unconventional approaches and 'interuptive' methods. I was also told that this
                  approach is a risk because I do not know where this exploration will end up as but I was encouraged to
                  keep
                  exploring various senses and sensors. It was also implied that I should watch the online seminar and
                  recosider the trajectory of my reserach.
