                <p>
                  During the first workshop, the atelier was introduced to the
                  different components of an Arduino kit and
                  the resources available online to get started in arduino.

                  We were then introduced to the different components such as
                  motion sensor, light sensor, etc, and the
                  one that I found partcularly simple and straightforwatd was
                  the servo motor.

                      Going to an electronic store can be intimadating so the
                      best I could do was to prepare a shopping
                      list. Sunlight @ Sim Lim Tower at Rochor, Singapore, has
                      pretty good staff that are willing to assist
                      in your questions.

                      After shopping for close to an hour, while googling and
                      making assumption of the compenents, I got
                      seven items which amounted to $86. The experience was a
                      tiny bit scary, expensive but everything felt
                      a little better after I was greeted by a heart from the

                    Keeping things simple, the first thing I tried was to get
                    the motor moving. It opened Arduino’s website
                    to get a sample code for motor and within 30mins I got the
                    motor to move.

                    Next, I explored how I can incorporate the pulling mechanism
                    of the prototype to the servo motor. My
                    first
                    idea was to makeshift a coiling mechanism for the string.
                    So, the first iterations included chopstick,
                    tapes and wallplug.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    One of the major component in this set-up is the importance
                    of keeping both the motor and prototype
                    stucked to the surface. Although the tape worked for the
                    prosthetic, the tape holding down the motor
                    kept breaking off each time it moved. The coiling method did
                    not work either. Neither did simplifying
                    the coiling prototype helped.

                      Feeling frustrated I asked Tammy for help and she
                      suggested why don’t I just tie the string into the
                      holes of the motor blade. To solve the tension problem
                      between motor and prototype, I decided to make
                      use the table and more tapes to provide better support.

                      This set up was successful and some of the key factors
                      were (1) building good tension between motor
                      and prosthetic and (2) tying knot straight onto the
                      provided blades of motor.

                      Reflection: <br> The prototype is successful however it
                      did not have the same intimacy as before. The
                      first
                      prototype felt more intimate as there was an input and
                      output by human efforts. This prototype only
                      has an input and output that is pre-determined. Hence, my
                      next iterations would involve another
                      sensor as input.

                      The interviews were helpful in
                      knowing people around my age have the desire to
                      form emotional
                      connection with the natural (physical) world.<br><br>
                      Holding hands are intimate for humans. Science has an
                      explanation called the 'oxytocin', often called
                      the "love hormone" or "bonding hormone as it evokes a
                      sense of security and closeness. Throughout
                      history, humans have
                      always engage in their sense of touch for survival,
                      relying on
                      close physical proximity to form social bonds and ensure
                      protection within groups.

                        However, the idea of physical closeness blurs as we
                        enter a digital age where our senses and
                        perception are constantly shaped and altered with
                        technological devices. <br><br> Acknowledging the
                        good and bad of electronic devices between humans, my
                        question lies with the non-humans. In what ways
                        might
                        sensing machines (or electronic devices) mediate social
                        bonds between humans and non-humans, raising
                        questions about the nature of mutual protection and
                        intimacy in interactions like physical touch or
                        holding hands?

                        <p>
                          It wasn't much of a feedback but more of a
                          appreciation for my creative journey and expression. I
                          was
                          then
                          introduced to a online seminar of
                          'A Knowing Wrongness' by Fraser Muggeridge - a graphic
                          designer who
                          did his PHD thesis on unconventional approaches and
                          'interuptive' methods. I was also told that this
                          approach is a risk because I do not know where this
                          exploration will end up as but I was encouraged to
                          keep
                          exploring various senses and sensors. It was also
                          implied that I should watch the online seminar and
                          recosider the trajectory of my reserach.
