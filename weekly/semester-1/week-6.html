                Going into this week, I recognised that the research proposal outline (RPO) and other commitments had
                taken up much of my time. I decided to leave them aside and started making things to gain some clarity.
                I may not know the research objectives for now, but I know my source of inspiration and how they relate.

              <p>
                By experimenting with materials to extend my bod, the objective was to examine my interest
                in various form of an ‚Äòextended senses‚Äô. Inspired by the materials used by various artists and
                designers, I indulged in my imagination through four different exercises covering my hands and face.
                The following slides break down my thought process, learnings and reflection in working on each of the
                exercises. To narrowing down the form of extension I prefer.

                  Experimenting with leaves, wire and wall plug to extend my fingers I picked a dead leaf on the way
                  home and had an idea to pluck them apart to past onto each of my fingers. I included the wires and
                  wall plug so that I could attempt to tie each stem of leaves to a string to pull them. After altering
                  my fingers, I performed ordinary tasks such as typing on my keyboard and waving to a tree!

              <p>
                In my next exercise, I was prompted by the fact that snails have poor sense of sight. They just sense
                the world with either dark or light light. They don‚Äôt see colour. So I embarked on a mission to make a
                snail head, which I still have not finished. It is still ongoing and I have plans to make it happen.

                All in all, the experiments were good. The pretence of being an automated machine reminded the
                atelier of the term ‚ÄúMachinal Turk.‚Äù. Machinal Turk is a comes from a famous 18th-century hoax: a
                chess-playing machine that appeared to play autonomously but had a hidden human operator inside.
                Now, the term has been reimagined by Amazon an online platform where businesses can outsource small,
                simple tasks to a large pool of workers who complete them for payment. <br><br>
                The idea of <em>hidden human assistance</em> intrigues me, however, when I was questioned
                about how these
                experiments
                meet my research objectives, I couldn't give a straightforward answer. It was at this moment, I
                realised
                I needed to
                iron out my readings to provide a foundation for more learnings.

                Returning to last week's question of how well I can convey the interest in this interaction with
                non-human
                species. I learned about Gabrys's "Program Earth" and the term "interspecies" where computational
                sensors or electronic devices
                are used to encourage people to care more about our planet with a goal of mutually benfitting human and
                non-human entities.

                  Reading up on Program Earth, I also learnt about how environment sensors, such as sensors for air
                  pollution and
                  temperature, can also be used in a creative environmental projects to contribute to the discussion.

                <p>
                  The experiments and findings were great however my RPO still needed work. Determined to figure out my RPO, I started a Miro board to organise my
                  findings in the three research pillars
                  (1.Speculative Design, 2.Senses mediated by Technology, 3.Queer Ecology). However, when I tried
                  grouping pieces of information from various readings, it became a giant web of information that did
                  not link with one another. <br><br> So, I kept writing different versions, changing my pillars as I
                  read up on new things to draw relations. At some point, I even ended up with pillars like IoT,
                  Cyborgs, and speculative design‚Äîwhich I knew so little about. The slippery slope ended with me
                  sleeping on it, which ended up: (1)THE THEORETICAL PRACTICE OF QUEER ECOLOGY, (2)CITIZEN SENSING AND
                  ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS
