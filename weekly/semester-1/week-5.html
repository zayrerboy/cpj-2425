              </h1>
              <p>
                Going into week 5, we were tasked to start framing our concepts and present them in a "concept" mindmap
                including the
                three reserach pillars and how they overlap. Starting to be overwhelmed with concepts, I seeked
                speculative design and
                existing practioners for some clarity.

                The concept mindmap branches out from human and nature relationship with queer ecology as a framework,
                technological sensors as a tool and speculative/critical design as a vehicle to (well, at this point)
                reframe people's mindset about being close to nature.</p>

                After presenting my Research Proposal Outline, the atelier‚Äôs feedback was that I needed to stop
                describing and start drawing parallels. I was then given a suggestion
                that I do not need to write straight away in Google Docs. I can put my reading notes first and then
                bring them together on Google Docs. He suggested that my second pillar should be "sensing" instead of
                "sensors".

                At this point of my research, one of the main challenge was not being able to find the right readings
                especially related to design. The question that was bogging me was "am i even design at this point?".
                Prompted by the frustration, I went to read on a literature review on "Ethics, Ecology, and the Future:
                Art and Design Face the Anthropocene" by Kayla Anderson - where I reflected on the differences between
                art and design in environmental projects.

                As I was busy with other commitments during this week, my research were mainly seeking communities or
                practitioners around the
                body and nature or nature and computational design where they blur the lines between natural and
                unnatural
                relationships with the environment.

                The writer suggests that projects led by design have a greater chance of minimising human biases because
                they
                approach people rather than inviting them to change their mindsets. This is why speculative design
                exists, a method of design that inspires designers or artists keen on advocating for climate action to
                continue finding the middle ground. It adds to diverse projects contributing to an equitable planet for
                all species.

                  I just realized that my area of interest is particularly challenging‚Äîafter all, this is a
                  communication design course. One of the biggest hurdles in my research is figuring out how to
                  effectively convey my fascination with interactioning with non-human species, while using
                  technology as a means to encourage environmental care.

                  The obvious solution would be to curate existing case studies into an engaging medium. However, my
                  goal goes beyond that‚ÄîI want to contribute to these ‚Äòalternative‚Äô human-nature interactions through
                  design by adding my own case study to the conversation.
