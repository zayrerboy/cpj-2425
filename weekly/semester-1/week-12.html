                This week, I updated my catalogue of making, created a small publication, and reflected on the summative
                feedback for my dissertation draft. This reflection presented a crossroads filled with doubts,
                uncertainties, and insecurities. Ultimately, I did not reach a decision. If this CPJ were a TV show,
                this week would have ended with a corny cliffhanger HAHA.

                  Since Week 7, I have made several changes to my experiments. I began exploring Arduino and p5.js,
                  where I created an artificial hand and asked people what they imagine when they think of holding
                  hands. Additionally, I developed a drawing pad that helps people visualize the unnatural.

                  This week, the atelier had a surprise visit from the Dean, Nur, and we were asked to present our
                  process. In preparation, I created a small zine that showcases the stories I learned through
                  experimentation. The zine follows my CPJ and aims to guide the user through my experiments.

                  Reflection:
                  Presenting my zine to the class was quite overwhelming as I have a lot to share, which mostly were
                  stories of my discoveries. And through this zine, I realise storytelling is more than just being
                  honest with my thoughts and wild imagination, there should be a point to the story - and right now
                  the point is very vague and lack specifics. But this struggle is part of the process, I make it
                  happen first
                  and then make it good later. The goal is vague also because I have not decided specificially what kind
                  of
                  human and nature relationship I am refering to. Furthermore, what environmental degradation am I
                  refering too? Is it climate change, water pollution or soil, air pollution?

              <p>
                As expected, my RPO feedback was the lack of specifics in my objective. The general advise is to based
                my research enquiry on "how sensors either enable or disable our interactions with the environment"
                while second marker suggested: "how sensor technology affect human agency and our relationship with
                nature".

                  Reflection: I am having doubts about my progress thus far as my making does not support that suggested
                  enquiry of "how sensors either enable or disbale our interactions with the environment". It seems like
                  my discoveries up till this point are still scratching the surface of speculative design and
                  environmental degredation. I feel genuinely lost stuck right now because it's either I come up with a
                  sketch that reimgaines how human can sense the natural environment (which means possibly forgoing my
                  mini
                  experimentations) or I reframe my research to something more relevant to what I have been making.

                  This week has been quite overwhelming as Iâ€™ve come to realize that my experiments do not add fit into
                  my dissertation and might all be leading to either the dumps. The week has ended which means I have 2
                  weeks left to submit my dissertation update and 3 weeks to showcase a prototype. The next step is
                  crucial and I have to narrow down my reserach thesis to focus on a single aspect.
